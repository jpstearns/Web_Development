	This dude Thoth is a straight up OG when it comes to
	religious dieties of the world. He is said to have lived
	as early as 35,000 BC. Pythagarous gives credit to his 
	famous equation A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup>=C<sup>2</sup> to
	the knowledge imparted upon him during his time studying in 
	Egypt under the human form of Thoth, the Thrice Great Hermes
	Trismagistas.  The first name for "God" was Tetragrammaton. 
	In Greek this translates to the four letters. However, one 
	can't help but notice the tetra in the name. Tetra... Like
	tetraheadron, which is a pyramid. Grammaton meaning grammer
	could also be translated to mean geometry because the Greeks
	based their alphabet on mathematics. Well this God thoth who
	taught Pythagarous everything there is to know about triangles
	also takes credit for the building of the pyramids.</p>
